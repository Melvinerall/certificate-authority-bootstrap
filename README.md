# certificate-authority-bootstrap

This project provides a template and some helper scripts to create your own Root and Intermediate Certificate
Authorities.

[FAQs](#faqs)

# Quickstart

## 1) Initialise the Root and Intermediate CAs

### Steps
_This is for *NIX systems._
 
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BobWaffle/certificate-authority-bootstrap.git

# Change into the repo directory
cd certificate-authority-bootstrap

# Clone the CA template using the helper script
./bin/bootstrap-ca.sh MyNewCA

# Change into the new CA directory
cd ./private/MyNewCA

# Initialise the Root CA using the helper script
./bin/01CreateRootCAKeyAndCert.sh

# Initialise the Intermediate01 CA using the helper script
./bin/02CreateIntermediate01CAKeyAndCert.sh
 ```

**DO NOT CUT-AND-PASTE THE ABOVE COMMANDS IN ONE BLOCK**  Why?  Because you're going to be prompted for passwords etc.


## 2) Get Signing

Now you're ready to start signing your own certificates using your intermediate authority.

```
# Make sure you're in the new Certificate Authority directory
cd certificate-authority-bootstrap/private/MyNewCA

# Run the certificate signing helper script
./bin/SignCertificateWithIntermediate01CA.sh www.somedomain.com api.somedomain.com blah.somedomain.com
```

The script `SignCertificateWithIntermediate01CA.sh` accepts any numbers of domains as parameters.  Note that the first
domain becomes the Common Name of the certificate and all other names are Subject Alternative Names.
 
You can use the script as many times as you want, passing a different Common Name each time. e.g.

```
./bin/SignCertificateWithIntermediate01CA.sh www.somedomain.com api.somedomain.com blah.somedomain.com
./bin/SignCertificateWithIntermediate01CA.sh www.somethingelse.com
./bin/SignCertificateWithIntermediate01CA.sh www.another.com alternative.another.com

```

## 3) \[Optional\] Trust Your Own CAs

This step allows you to add one or both of your Certificate Authorities to your device(s) on which you want to trust
them.

**Why _might_ you do this?**  So you don't get prompted by your device that "The Certificate is not trusted".

**What is the danger of doing this?**  Good question!  I'm glad you asked.  **Remember:**  _Once you trust your own
Certificate Authority at the operating system level, you will never see any warnings for SSL certificates that were
signed by that Certificate Authority._

**Why is that dangerous?**  Imagine someone got hold of your CA files (and password) and generated an SSL certificate
for www.yourbank.com.  They'd then be able to pretend to be https://www.yourbank.com and your browser wouldn't warn you.

**I don't understand** Well... perhaps you shouldn't be mucking around with Certificate Authorites.  Don't say I didn't
warn you.

**OK OK - I understand the risks... what do I do?**  Exactly _what_ you do depends on your requirements (do you need to
install the Root CA or is the Intermediate CA sufficient?)  One you know which you want to install, simply add the
relevant certificate to your operating system's Trusted Certificates.

**I don't know if I should install the Root or Intermediate CA Cert...**
* **If you install the Root CA** then _all certificates signed by the Root CA or any of your intermediate CAs will be
trusted_.  (The scripts I have provided only create a single Intermediate CA... but you could choose to make more.)
* **If you install the Intermediate CA** then _only certificates signed by the Intermediate CA will be trusted_.

**Erm... HOW do I trust a CA on my device of type X?**  Google it.

# Not (Yet) Supported

## CRLs
I've not yet written any tools to manage certificate revocation / CRLs.  I might get round to this if either of these
things happen:
 * Someone asks me to do it
 * I need to do it for my own purposes (not looking likely at the time of writing)
  
## Windows
I've only written `bash` scripts, I'm sorry to say.  If someone asks nicely I may be able to make some `.bat` files.
Although now that I think of this, I kinda regret the `sed` expressions I've used in some of my shell scripts.

# FAQs

#### Why is the FAQs section so empty?
Because no-one has asked me any questions.
